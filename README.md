# Quantum-Shift
Players control a 5x5 grid of quantum particles (represented by numbers) that must be shifted to match a target pattern. Each move consumes energy, and players must solve the puzzle within a limited number of moves.

Quantum Shift: A C++ Puzzle Game
Quantum Shift is a console-based puzzle game written in C++. Players manipulate a 5x5 grid of quantum particles to match a target pattern within a limited number of moves. This project demonstrates C++ skills like grid manipulation, file I/O, and game state management, making it both a fun game and an educational tool.
Features

Dynamic Puzzles: Randomly generated grids and target patterns for each level.
Energy System: Solve puzzles within a limited number of moves to maximize your score.
Level Progression: Increasing difficulty with more particles as levels advance.
Save/Load: Persist your game state to continue playing later.
Score System: Earn points based on moves saved and levels completed.
Simple Controls: Use commands like r 0 l (shift row 0 left), c 1 u (shift column 1 up), s to save, or q to quit.

How to Play

Clone the repository: git clone <your-repo-url>
Compile the game: g++ QuantumShift.cpp -o QuantumShift
Run the game: ./QuantumShift (Linux/Mac) or QuantumShift.exe (Windows)
Shift rows or columns to align the grid ('Q' for particles, '.' for empty) with the target grid.
Use commands like r <row> l/r or c <col> u/d to shift rows or columns.
Save progress with s and load on startup.
Solve puzzles to advance levels and maximize your score!
